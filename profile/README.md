building autonomous systems for autonomous humans

Our philosophy is simple: Most "maintenance" work exists because systems were built wrong in the first place. We fix that.

- ⚡ Your data pipeline shouldn't need an army of DevOps to stay alive
- 🌑 Good engineering eliminates problems. Bad engineering perpetuates them
- 🎭 Build new things. Stop maintaining broken ones

What we actually do:

- Make data pipelines that handle terabytes without drama
- Build infrastructure that doesn't wake you up at 3am
- Create automation that removes work instead of creating it
- Design systems that scale without needing therapy

Tech stack: Whatever solves the problem.

We're a small team of engineers who enjoy building things that work.

Remote because talent is everywhere. Autonomous because micromanagement is cancer. Based because we build what works, not what's trending.

The best systems are the ones you forget exist.
